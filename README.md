# About Jekyll Epoch Time

A plugin for Jekyll to make it possible to use Unix Epoch time in the permalink structures of your Jekyll site.

# What it does

Jekyll Epoch Time allows you to use the `:epoch` placeholder in your `_config.yml` file to automatically generate permalinks based on the time since the [Unix Epoch Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (1 January 1970).
